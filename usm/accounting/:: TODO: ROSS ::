// TODO: ROSS // 

1: The detail view of accounts is stupid.
2: You cannot view the logs of a transaction/invoice/bill in the detail view because they are excluded in the form.
3: In transaction_method creation, have the requires bank_recnocilliation set by jscript.
4: Create an error for when the transaction form is incorrectly filled
